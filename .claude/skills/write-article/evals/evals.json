With a few taps on a smartphone, we can summon food, transportation, or entertainment in minutes. But as these systems have grown more seamless, something quieter has happened beneath the surface: we have gradually outsourced our discomfort.\n\nThe problem isn't convenience itself. It's that convenience, in its current form, often functions as an avoidance mechanism. When we can skip any moment of friction — the wait, the walk, the conversation — we begin to lose our tolerance for difficulty. And with that tolerance goes something harder to name: the capacity to sit with a problem long enough to actually solve it.\n\nThis essay argues that the real cost of convenience culture is not laziness, but a shrinking threshold for difficulty — and that recovering it requires deliberate friction.\n---",
