# Zynkr Writing Agent

A modular article writing pipeline built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), designed for Zynkr's content team. Seven specialized agents handle each stage of the writing process — from ideation to CTA — orchestrated by a single `/write-article` command.

## Install

### Option 1: Install into your current Claude workspace

If you already have a project open in Claude Code and want to add this writing pipeline into that workspace, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter-tu-zynkr/writing-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This installs:

- `.claude/skills/write-article/`
- all 7 supporting files in `.claude/agents/`

If you want to install into a different workspace path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter-tu-zynkr/writing-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- "/path/to/your/project"
```

### Option 2: Manual install

Copy the Claude assets into your target workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p "/path/to/your/project/.claude/agents" "/path/to/your/project/.claude/skills"
cp .claude/agents/*.md "/path/to/your/project/.claude/agents/"
cp -R .claude/skills/write-article "/path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/write-article"
```

### Option 3: Run it directly from this repo

If you prefer to use the repo as-is, clone it and open Claude Code in the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peter-tu-zynkr/writing-agent.git
cd writing-agent
claude
```

## Pipeline Overview

```
 Ideation → Structure → Drafting → Editing → Titles → CTA
   (0)        (1)        (2)        (3)       (4)     (5)
```

| Stage | Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | `socratic-ideation-partner` | Guides vague ideas into a refined premise through Socratic dialogue |
| 1 | `article-style-selector` | Recommends article structures (9 templates) and maps section key points |
| 2 | `article-drafter` | Writes the draft section-by-section (~1000–1200 words) following a style guide |
| 3 | `article-editor` | Reviews against editorial rules, checks forbidden words, removes AI-sounding language |
| 3.5 | `reader-perspective` | (Optional) Scores the article on a 100-point rubric with critical analysis |
| 4 | `article-title-suggester` | Generates 10 SEO-optimized title suggestions |
| 5 | `cta-writer` | Produces 3 CTA options matched to the article's goal |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

### Usage

Open the workspace that contains the installed skill in Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

Then invoke the orchestrator:

```
/write-article
```

The orchestrator detects what you already have and starts from the appropriate stage. You can also pass a topic directly:

```
/write-article 我想寫一篇關於AI工具的文章
```

### Using Individual Agents

Each agent can also be invoked independently via the Task tool. For example, if you only need editing:

```
Help me edit this article: [paste your draft]
```

Claude will automatically route to the `article-editor` agent, as long as the `.claude/agents` files from this repo are installed in the current workspace.
